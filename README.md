### Problem Statement

For over 20 years, cross-country (XC) ski enthusiasts in the midwest have relied on [SkinnySki.com](https://www.skinnyski.com) as the go-to website for cross-country ski information. The site has information on XC ski races, training, tips and trails.  The trail data includes descriptions, location/driving directions, trail maps, trail type (skate versus classic) and conditions (rolled, tracked, skiied in). While most trail systems have their own websites with this type of information, SkinnySki's benefit is that all the trail information is located in one place.  Even better, users are encouraged to add their own trail reports which means SkinnySki.com tends to be the most current source of information.  

With the growing popularity of winter fat biking (riding bikes with 3.5" or larger tires in the snow), riders have found themselves in need of a site similar to SkinnySki.com to discover and share fat bike trails and conditions. Currently, trail information is found on various social media sites and web sites, or is simply shared in email among those "in the know". I'd like to build a Fat Bike Trail Reports website to serve as the SkinnySki.com for fat biking.
