### Problem Statement

My Friend has been traveling a lot lately and wanted a cool and interactive way 
to document the locations heâ€™s been to. I was thinking to create an application 
with a collage of images on an html page. Those images would be intractable allowing 
him to click revealing more information and images. This webpage would receive its 
information from an sql server housing all the data.

### Main Features:
- Logging data
- Updating data
- Storing images
